# StockMarketCrashProbability
Visualization of logistic regressions for forecasting stock market crash and correction probabilities
based on historical data using Shiller CAPE.

At current valuation levels the odds of a correction for the next year is about 25 percent, and the
probability of a crash is about 15 percent. High valuation levels seem to lead to corrections and crashes less than expected.

A correction is defined as stocks being down more than 10 percent, and a crash is defined as being down more than 20 percent.

Also includes the same analysis done with P/B and P/E
